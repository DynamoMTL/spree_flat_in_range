SpreeFlatInRange
================

A [Spree calculator](http://guides.spreecommerce.com/adjustments.html)
to calculate fixed adjustments based on ranges.

For example, **free shipping above $100, and $4.39 for all orders under $100**, would mean a range *from 0 to
$99.99*, that *has a fixed shipping rate of $4.39*.


Usage
=====

Add to your gemfile in a Spree application:

`` gem 'spree_flat_in_range'

Then visit shipping or tax to use the calculation.

Testing
-------

Be sure to bundle your dependencies and then create a dummy test app for the specs to run against.

    $ bundle
    $ bundle exec rake test app
    $ bundle exec rspec spec
